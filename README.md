# Data Structures Practical Assignment 

## Assignments 1

1. **Array Pointer Matching**  
   - Write a program to check if two different pointers point to the same location in an array.

2. **String Length with Pointer**  
   - Implement a program to find the length of a string using pointers.

3. **Min and Max in Array**  
   - Write a program to find the minimum and maximum values in an array using pointers.

4. **Pointer Testing**  
   - Perform various operations on pointers (e.g., `*p++`, `p--`, `*++p`).

5. **Student Structure and Sorting**  
   - Implement a student structure and display student details sorted by SGPA in descending order.

6. **Pointer to Student Structure**  
   - Modify program 5 to use a pointer to the student structure.

7. **1D and 2D Array Operations**  
   - Write a program to perform common operations on one-dimensional and two-dimensional arrays.

8. **3D Array for Marks**  
   - Use a 3D array to store and retrieve marks of a student.

9. **Array Element Location**  
   - Find the location of an element in both one-dimensional and two-dimensional arrays.

10. **Stack Operations**  
    - Write a menu-driven program to perform the following stack operations:
      - Push
      - Pop
      - Peep
      - Display
      - Display from Top to Bottom
      - Display from Bottom to Top

11. **User-defined Stack Functions**  
    - Implement a program using custom functions like `push()` and `pop()` for stack operations.

12. **Stack with Pointers**  
    - Implement stack operations using pointers.

13. **Reverse String with Stack**  
    - Write a program to reverse a string using a stack.

14. **Infix to Postfix Conversion**  
    - Convert an infix expression to a postfix expression using a stack.

15. **Postfix Expression Evaluation**  
    - Write a program to evaluate a postfix expression.

16. **Merge Character Stacks**  
    - Enter elements into two separate character stacks and merge them one-by-one into a third stack.
